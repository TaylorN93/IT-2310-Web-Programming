    <h1>Taylor Norman – Welcome to My Page</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Taylor Norman, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I enjoy exploring new technologies, building projects, and continuously learning.</p>

    <p>This is my first HTML web page as part of a lab assignment. I look forward to developing more advanced web pages as the course progresses.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI and Automation</li>
        <li>Digital Design</li>
        <li>Travel and Exploration</li>
        <li>Fitness and Wellness</li>
        <li>Creative Writing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of my favorite learning resources is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>.</p>
